The Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_by_per_capita_income) was scraped using the BeautifulSoup library to build a pandas dataframe listing the cities, states and percapita income. The dataframe was cleaned and processed appropriately.

The Foursquare API is then used to get the venues in each city of United States Based on the categories of each venue as decided by the CEO, we have assigned weights to each of them and got the city that has the maximum weight.
